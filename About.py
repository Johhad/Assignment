During my last DSHI course I have gained knowledge on how to use programming as a tool for calculation of data, 
visualization of data and also how to present data. From using classification, supervised learning to determain
prediction or classification, grouping up similar data, different machine learning models, their purpse and
how to use them. Having a background in healthcare I have an understanding of how to apply machine learning 
into a real world healthcare setting. The possibilites are endelss and the ideas "pops" up at any time. 
There is still alot to learn and still alot to understand about machine learning. It seems very positiv, although
machine learning and AI would make healthcare better (which I do believe), I have also learned from DSHI 
courses that we must not forget about the ethical aspect with machine learning and AI
